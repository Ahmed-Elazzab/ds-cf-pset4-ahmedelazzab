# Place all aif pipeline commands which should be executed instead of default CICD aif pipeline --all-pipelines
# example: aif pipeline run --pipelines my_pipe --platform Vertex --scope my-scope -p myparam=myvalue
# One command per line, lines starting with # are skipped, at least one line starting with aif, if there is no commands to execute, CICD will run --all-pipelines instead
